# Quickstart

In this brief tutorial, you'll learn how to use Foliant to build websites and pdf documents from a single Markdown source. You'll also learn how to include remote documents and diagrams in your documentation with Foliant preprocessors.

Before you go further, make sure Foliant is [installed](installation.md) or set up with [Docker](#docker).
